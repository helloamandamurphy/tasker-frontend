# Dev Log
*Started a little late, on April 2. But what the heck.*

## What's Working / Done
* User Signup, Login, Logout
* User can view and create new lists
* Videos 1-12
* Need to update NavBar to show different options when the user is logged in or not logged in.
* When I sign in, the sign in form is still rendering.
* Add basic navigation via NavBar

## What's Left To Do
* Change Signup/Login password input type to password vs. text
* Add/view tasks
* Add CSS
* Address unnecessary imported Files
* Address time conformity issue (see screenshot for error)
* In Redux store, Lists: and MyLists look identical. Both aren't necessary.
* EditListFormWrapper and NewListFormWrapper probably should not be in the containers folder.

### For Project Completion
* Write Blog Post
* Record Demo Video
* Submit Project
* Schedule Assessment
* Pass Assessment

## What Can Wait For Later Development


## What to Review for Assessment
* Types of React Components (and the project requirements for those components)
* Async vs. sync actions / action creators
* Dispatch
* Connect
* Redux Module
* Switch
